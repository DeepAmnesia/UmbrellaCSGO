It's an internal cheat for CS:GO based on CSGOSimple SDK.
The main feature of this project is hooking some game engine functions to make cheat stuff (already made AimBot, ESP visuals for grenades, weapons, some Misc. stuff like bhop, strafes, color and fov modulation, etc)
Also, I tried to make visuals more beautiful with alpha clamping, some animations and game model chams preview
Just for educational purposes
